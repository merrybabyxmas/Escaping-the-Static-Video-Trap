\section{Conclusion and Call to Action}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced \textbf{Dynamic-MSV-Bench} and a novel decoupled evaluation framework to address the systemic blind spots in Text-to-Multi-Shot Video (T2MSV) generation. By distinguishing between \textbf{Track S (Semantic Leap)} and \textbf{Track M (Motion Continuity)}, we have mathematically and qualitatively exposed the \textbf{Static Video Trap} and the \textbf{Amnesia Trap}. 

Our findings indicate that current paradigms are fundamentally incapable of achieving the high-consistency, high-dynamics regime required for professional narrative. The field must pivot toward \textbf{Decoupled Dynamics}—architectures that isolate identity priors from narrative-driven motion priors. We believe our benchmark provides the necessary diagnostic tool to track and catalyze progress toward truly cinematic, multi-shot AI video.
